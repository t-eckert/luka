## Backstory

I have been fascinated by reverse polish notation (RPN) calculators since college. Last year, I created an [RPN calculator web-app](http://rpn.herokuapp.com/) in React while I was learning the framework. It's not great. This is a new project with the same goals from scratch to push my learning of Rust, WASM, and Vue. I don't know if it will be successful, but my goal is to be radically transparent. I am going to log the whole project to share my progress.  

## Design

I am designing the UI in Figma. You can follow along and comment [here](https://www.figma.com/file/rhgSHZhr0glvEwKqDv99rp/Luka?node-id=0%3A1).
