## Backstory

I have been fascinated by reverse polish notation (RPN) calculators since college. Last year I created an RPN calculator web-app in React while I was learning the framework. It's not great. Now, I am going to create a new project with the same goals from scratch to push my learning of Rust, WASM, and Vue. I don't know if it will be successful, but my goal is to be radically transparent. I am going to log the whole project to share my progress.
