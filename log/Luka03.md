# Luka 03

Date: 10 September 2019

One button is good, but does not a calculator make. It's time to add components for `ButtonPush` and `ButtonNumber`.

Before starting that, I am just going to change the page title in the base HTML to Luka. I want to make a cool favicon too, but that can wait until I have the design and color scheme nailed down.
